# MavenExercise

This project creates a histogram, that represents the frequencies of the grades that are contained in a file. 
In order to run the Histogram Gnerator project on your computer, you have just to install maven. 
Once you do that and the project runs, you will be asked to type the path of the file that contains the grades.
